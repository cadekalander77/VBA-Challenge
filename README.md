# VBA-Challenge

## Overview Of Project
The purpose of this challenge is to refine the code within excel making it easier to read, while being more efficient. By making the code more efficient it allows the code to run faster and more smoothly on a larger data set. A variety of code can be used to run a small data set, however in order to get best results across a large data set it is necesary to optimize the code.

### Stock Performance
The results, as shown, are the stocks examined performed much better in 2017 than in 2018. Not only can we see this based off of the percentage return, however we can now easily see if a stock has had a gain or a loss based on the highlighted color. A majority of the stocks are in the green in 2017, but in 2018 the majority are in the red. This table allows for a quick overview of the stocks to determine the performance of the market, also it allows for in depth analysis by looking at the percent return for each individual stock.
### Execution Times
As for the execution times for the script before and After the code refining, I did not personally see a significant change in run times. However, I am sure if this was used on a larger data set we would be able to see an improvement in times.

## Summary
The advantages to refactoring code is making the code more user friendly as well as more effcient time and space wise. As for the disadvantages, it will obviously take a little more time to refactor the code, however it will be worth it especially on larger data sets. You can see within this refactor, the table is easier to read due to the color coding, however I did not see a significant chnage in run time.
